# Site URL (for invitation links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Email Function

Use the test email function to verify your setup:

```typescript
import { emailService } from "@/lib/services/email-service";

// Test email delivery
const result = await emailService.sendTestEmail("your-email@example.com");
console.log(result);
```

In development, emails are sent to your configured email address. Check your Resend dashboard for delivery status.
